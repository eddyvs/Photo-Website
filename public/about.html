        <p id="about_me_description">Hello and thank you for coming to my site! It is a culmination of my photography that I wanted to share with the world. I will keep this short but it means a lot that you would take time to look at my art. It has taken me a lot of time, effort and money to get the photos you see before you, please enjoy them and spread them with the world. If you do so, please tag me! It lets me spread my artform further. Thank you for listening.</p>
